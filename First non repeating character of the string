The map doesn't preserve the order of characters in the string. So, when you loop through the map, you're not checking characters 
in the order they appeared in the string.

class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find the first non-repeating character in a string.
    char nonRepeatingChar(string &s) {
        // Your code here
        unordered_map<char,int> mpp;
        for(char c:s)
        {
            mpp[c]++;
        }
        for(char c:s)
        {
            if(mpp[c]==1)
            {
                return c;
            }
        }
        return '$';
    }
};
